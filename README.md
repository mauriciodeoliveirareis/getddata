Getting and Cleaning Data Peer Assignment Script
========

This project contains the script run_analisys.R that, with the current working directory being inside the sansung data directory from this excercise, will run and generate two text documents: finalData.txt and finalMeanData.txt. Thos documents are further explained in the CodeBook.md file.
It's important to notice that those scripts require the lib sqldf to run correctly.
